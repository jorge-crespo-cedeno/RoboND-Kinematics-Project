### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

The file kr210.urdf.xacro and the graph shown above, are the sources to obtain the DH table, as follows:

* alpha<sub>0</sub> is zero becausen z<sub>0</sub> and z<sub>1</sub> are parallel.
* a<sub>0</sub> is zero because there is no displacement between z<sub>0</sub> and z<sub>1</sub>.
* d<sub>1</sub> is the diplacement between x<sub>0</sub> and x<sub>1</sub> along z<sub>1</sub>, which in the xacro file is the z position of joint_1 w.r.t the base (0.33), plus the z position of joint_2 w.r.t joint_1 (0.42).

* alpha<sub>1</sub> is the angle between z<sub>1</sub> and z<sub>2</sub> measured about x<sub>1</sub> (-pi/2).
* a<sub>1</sub> is the displacement between z<sub>1</sub> and z<sub>2</sub> along x<sub>1</sub>, which in the xacro file is the x position of joint_2 with respect to joint_1 (0.35).
* d<sub>2</sub> is zero because there is no displacement between x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>.

* alpha<sub>2</sub> is zero because z<sub>2</sub> and z<sub>3</sub> are parallel.
* a<sub>2</sub> is the displacement between z<sub>2</sub> and z<sub>3</sub> along x<sub>2</sub>, which in the xacro file is the z position of joint_3 w.r.t joint_2 (1.25).
* d<sub>3</sub> is zero because there is no displacement between x<sub>2</sub> and x<sub>3</sub>

* alpha<sub>3</sub> is the angle between z<sub>3</sub> and z<sub>4</sub> measured about x<sub>3</sub> (-pi/2).
* a<sub>3</sub> is the displacement between z<sub>3</sub> and z<sub>4</sub> along x<sub>3</sub>, which in the xacro file is the z position of joint_4 w.r.t joint_3 (-0.054)
* d<sub>4</sub> is the displacement between x<sub>3</sub> and x<sub>4</sub> along z<sub>4</sub>, which in the xacro file is the x position of joint_4 w.r.t joint_3 (0.96) plus the x position of joint_5 w.r.t joint_4 (0.54)

* alpha<sub>4</sub> is the angle between z<sub>4</sub> and z<sub>5</sub> measured about x<sub>4</sub> (pi/2).
* a<sub>4</sub> is zero because there is no displacement between z<sub>4</sub> and z<sub>5</sub>.
* d<sub>5</sub> is zero because there is no displacement between x<sub>4</sub> and x<sub>5</sub>.

* alpha<sub>5</sub> is the angle between z<sub>5</sub> and z<sub>6</sub> measured about x<sub>5</sub> (-pi/2).
* a<sub>5</sub> is zero because there is no displacement between z<sub>5</sub> and z<sub>6</sub>.
* d<sub>6</sub> is zero because there is no displacement between x<sub>5</sub> and x<sub>6</sub>.

* alpha<sub>6</sub> is zero because z<sub>6</sub> and z<sub>7</sub>, a.k.a z<sub>G</sub>, are parallel.
* a<sub>6</sub> is zero because there is no displacement between z<sub>6</sub> and z<sub>7</sub>.
* d<sub>7</sub> (a.k.a. d<sub>G</sub>) is the displacement between x<sub>6</sub> and x<sub>7</sub> (a.k.a. x<sub>G</sub>) along z<sub>7</sub>, which in the xacro file is the x position of joint_6 w.r.t. joint_5 (0.193) plus the x position of the gripper_joint w.r.t joint_6 (0.11)

The obtained DH table is as follows:

<sup>i-1</sup>T<sub>i</sub> | alpha<sub>i-1</sub> | a<sub>i-1</sub> | d<sub>i</sub> | theta<sub>i</sub>
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
<sup>0</sup>T<sub>1</sub> | alpha<sub>0</sub> = 0 | a<sub>0</sub> = 0 | d<sub>1</sub> = 0.75 | theta<sub>1</sub>
<sup>1</sup>T<sub>2</sub> | alpha<sub>1</sub> = -pi/2 | a<sub>1</sub> = 0.35 | d<sub>2</sub> = 0 | theta<sub>2</sub> = theta<sub>2</sub>-pi/2
<sup>2</sup>T<sub>3</sub> | alpha<sub>2</sub> = 0 | a<sub>2</sub> = 1.25 | d<sub>3</sub> = 0 | theta<sub>3</sub>
<sup>3</sup>T<sub>4</sub> | alpha<sub>3</sub> = -pi/2 | a<sub>3</sub> = -0.054 | d<sub>4</sub> = 1.50 | theta<sub>4</sub>
<sup>4</sup>T<sub>5</sub> | alpha<sub>4</sub> = pi/2 | a<sub>4</sub> = 0 | d<sub>5</sub> = 0 | theta<sub>5</sub>
<sup>5</sup>T<sub>6</sub> | alpha<sub>5</sub> = -pi/2 | a<sub>5</sub> = 0 | d<sub>6</sub> = 0 | theta<sub>6</sub>
<sup>6</sup>T<sub>7</sub> | alpha<sub>6</sub> = 0 | a<sub>6</sub> = 0 | d<sub>7</sub> = 0.303 | theta<sub>7</sub> = 0

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

The intersecion between x<sub>i</sub> and z<sub>i</sub> is the origin of the reference frame i. Let this origin be O<sub>i</sub>. The transformation from O<sub>i-1</sub> to O<sub>i</sub>, denoted by <sup>i-1</sup>T<sub>i</sub>, is the multiplication of the transformation matrices R<sub>x</sub>(alpha<sub>i-1</sub>)D<sub>x</sub>(a<sub>i-1</sub>)R<sub>z</sub>(theta<sub>i</sub>)D<sub>z</sub>(d<sub>i</sub>), which give the following matrix<br>
[[ cos(theta<sub>i</sub>)  -sin(theta<sub>i</sub>)  a<sub>i-1</sub> ]<br>
 [sin(theta<sub>i</sub>)cos(alpha<sub>i-1</sub>)  cos(theta<sub>i</sub>)cos(alpha<sub>i-1</sub>)  -sin(alpha<sub>i-1</sub>)  -sin(alpha<sub>i-1</sub>)d<sub>i</sub>]<br>
 [sin(theta<sub>i</sub>)sin(alpha<sub>i-1</sub>)  cos(theta<sub>i</sub>)sin(alpha<sub>i-1</sub>)  cos(alpha<sub>i-1</sub>)  cos(alpha<sub>i-1</sub>)d<sub>i</sub>]<br>
 [  0  0  0  1  ]]<br>

The homogeneous transformation matrix from base the end-effector is obtained by (<sup>0</sup>T<sub>ee</sub>) = (<sup>0</sup>T<sub>1</sub>)(<sup>1</sup>T<sub>2</sub>)(<sup>2</sup>T<sub>3</sub>)(<sup>3</sup>T<sub>4</sub>)(<sup>4</sup>T<sub>5</sub>)(<sup>5</sup>T<sub>6</sub>)(<sup>6</sup>T<sub>7</sub>)(<sup>7</sup>T<sub>ee</sub>), where <sup>7</sup>T<sub>ee</sub> is a correction matrix, since urdf specification uses a diferent reference frame at the end-effector than DH. The x and z urdf reference frame coordinates are x<sub>w</sub> and z<sub>w</sub> in the image above.

#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

<sup>i-1</sup>T<sub>i</sub> | alpha<sub>i-1</sub> | a<sub>i-1</sub> | d | theta
bla | ble | bli | blo | blu

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
